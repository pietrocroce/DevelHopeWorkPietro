     * 3: Write answers below for the following 4 situations, should we use a while, do while, fori or for each loop?
     *    Which would work best? Why?
     *
     * Q Example: Print out the numbers 1 to 10
     * A Example: fori
     *
     * Q1: A user inputs their actions into an ATM, they can withdraw, deposit, check balance or exit. What loop should we use?
     * A1:We should use a do while loop, as we will always want to check at least 1 user action. And we do not know how many actions the user will take
     *
     * Q2: We have a list of 1000 users to send emails to
     * A2:We should use a for each, or for i loop. We have a determinate number of emails to send. For each would be simpler
     *
     * Q3: We want to print out the first 80 customer names from our bank database
     * A3: We would want to use a for i loop, going from index 0 to 79 to process the 80 items. If there are more items here, a for each would process them too.
     *
     * Q4: We want to read a file 100 lines at a time, without loading the full file into our program
     * A4: We would want to use a while loop, as we only want to read the file if there are lines, but as we are not reading the full file at once. We do not know how many lines there are, so a for is inappropriate
